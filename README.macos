ptex-fontmaps-macos
===================

Current release: $VER$

This package is a companion to `ptex-fontmaps' including support for
macOS-specific fonts, which we decided not to be included in TeX Live.

The files contained in this package contain font maps for dvipdfmx to
make various macOS-specific Japanese fonts available for (u)ptex and
related programs and formats.

Please see the README for the package `ptex-fontmaps' for details 
concerning all fonts.
